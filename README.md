# Plotly_Deploy

## Project Overview

For this project we need to create an interactive dashboard to demonstrate Belly Button Biodiversity. The dashboared will allow us to identify the top 10 bacterial species of belly buttons and identify improbable species of bacteria to manufacture Synthetic Beef.

## Purpose

- To visualize the data for better understanding and to draw some conclusions as researchers and data analysts.
- The purpose of this research is to **gather, identify and analyze the biological data of individuals’ navels**.
- The research holds data of 153 individuals and their: 
  -	Unique and anonymous ID.
  -	Demographic information.
  -	Belly button scrubbing frequency.
  -	Belly button biological footprint.

## Requirements

- Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
- Create a Bubble Chart
- Create a Gauge Chart
- Customize the Dashboard

The individual can find information by **selecting a unique ID from a drop-down menu** and explore the data by deep diving in their own results or compare the results to other individuals. **This research is also public and easily accessible**, so anyone can learn more about belly button biodiversity and explore this fascinating field.

## Resources 

- **JavaScript, Plotly.js**
    - Advantages of the **JavaScript** and **Plotly.js** library is that there is no need of additional programs to install on a computer to *“run the code” *.
    - JavaScript to create visualizations that are attractive, accessible, and interactive.
    - The table is built by inserting **JavaScript** and **Plotly** into HTML page [charts.js](charts.js).
    
- **Data**
    - The data, stored in a json file [samples.json]( samples.json).

- **HTML**
    - To build the webpage [index.html](index.html).
    
- **CSS and Bootstrap**
    - To style the page [style.css](css/style.css)

- **Chrome Developer Tools to test the code.**
